Calculation of speed is based on counting pixels between two frame of images using velocity definition v=d/t, 

t is known based on setup of experiment; then just counting the pixel movement and mapping it to the real distance (based on part a, ratio of pixel to mm is known) will lead to speed calculation. In other words, the problem will reduce to finding movement of object in x and y axes, correspond to velocity in x and y respectively.
